# Motion_Prediction_Autonomous_Driving

Please see **Motion_Prediction_using_CNN_LSTM.pdf** for the project paper.

## Overview

This project uses the [Lyft Prediction dataset](https://level-5.global/data/prediction/) with the help of the 
[l5kit toolkit](https://github.com/woven-planet/l5kit) to build CNN+LSTM models for predicting the 
motions of surrounding vehicles on the road.

All the deep learning models used in this project were trained on kaggle. The CNN+LSTM training code can be run on 
kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/khushalbr/cs535-lstm-training/notebook).
